//BASIC INFO//
This name generator will automatically produce a stereotypical Call of Duty trickshot name for you base on 12 primary words and 12 secondary words.
Most likely all of the ones that will pop up are taken, because I am pretty accurate when it comes to stereotypes.
If you like this tool, then gimme karma you ungrateful bastard (jk I follow intergalactic law)
Also yes, I know how poorly it was written, I am pretty bad at programming. Also it's 2am.

You may to download Python 3 for this program to work, I don't know as I have it installed anyways.

To get it, download it from the official website here (clicking the link should auto download):
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3.amd64.msi

Or if you don't trust me you can just Google it yerself.
